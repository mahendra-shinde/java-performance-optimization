# Module 16: File I/O Optimization

## Overview

Efficient file input/output (I/O) operations are crucial for high-performance Java applications, especially those that process large datasets or interact frequently with the filesystem. Poorly optimized I/O can become a major bottleneck, leading to increased latency and reduced throughput.

## Key Topics

- Java I/O APIs: java.io, java.nio
- Buffered vs. unbuffered streams
- File channel and memory-mapped files
- Asynchronous and non-blocking I/O
- Best practices for reading/writing large files
- Reducing disk access and optimizing file access patterns
- Profiling and monitoring I/O performance

## Example: Buffered File Reading

```java
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("largefile.txt"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        // Process the line
    }
}
```

### Example: Non blocking I/O

```java
Path path = Paths.get("largefile.txt");
try (AsynchronousFileChannel channel = AsynchronousFileChannel.open(path, StandardOpenOption.READ)) {
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    Future<Integer> result = channel.read(buffer, 0);
    while (!result.isDone()) {
        // Perform other tasks while waiting for I/O to complete
    }
    int bytesRead = result.get();
    buffer.flip();
    // Process buffer data
}
```


## Tips

- Always use buffered streams for large or frequent file operations.
- Prefer NIO for scalable, high-throughput applications.
- Profile I/O operations to identify bottlenecks.
- Minimize the number of file open/close operations.
