# Final Best Practices for Java Performance

**1. Profile Before Optimizing:**
  - Use profilers (e.g., VisualVM, JProfiler, YourKit) to identify real bottlenecks before making changes. Guesswork can lead to wasted effort.

**2. Avoid Premature Optimization:**
  - Focus on writing clear, maintainable code first. Optimize only when there is evidence of a performance problem.

**3. Minimize Object Creation:**
  - Excessive object creation increases GC pressure. Reuse objects where possible, use primitive types, and prefer immutable objects for frequently used data.

**4. Reuse Resources:**
  - Pool expensive resources (threads, connections, buffers) and clean up resources promptly to avoid leaks.

**5. Monitor in Production:**
  - Continuously monitor application performance in production using telemetry and observability tools. Real-world usage often reveals issues not seen in testing.

**6. Stay Up-to-date:**
  - Keep dependencies, JVM, and libraries updated for the latest performance improvements and security patches.
