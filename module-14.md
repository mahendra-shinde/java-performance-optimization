# HTTP and Web Application Tuning

**1. Connection Pooling in HTTP Clients:**
  - Use HTTP clients (like Apache HttpClient, OkHttp) that support connection pooling to reuse TCP connections, reducing latency and resource usage.
  - Tune pool size based on expected concurrency.

**2. Caching Headers:**
  - Set appropriate HTTP caching headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified`) to enable client and proxy caching, reducing server load and response times.

**3. GZIP Compression:**
  - Enable GZIP or Brotli compression for HTTP responses to reduce payload size and improve transfer speed, especially for text-based content (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON).

**4. Avoid Blocking Operations in Web Endpoints:**
  - Use asynchronous request handling (e.g., Servlet 3.1 async, Spring WebFlux) to prevent thread starvation.
  - Offload long-running or blocking tasks to background workers or message queues.

**5. Minimize Payloads:**
  - Only send necessary data in responses. Use pagination and filtering for large datasets.

**6. Monitor and Profile:**
  - Use APM tools to monitor endpoint performance and identify bottlenecks.
