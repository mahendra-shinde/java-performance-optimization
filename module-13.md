# JDBC and I/O Performance Optimization

## JDBC Tuning

**1. Use Connection Pooling:**
  - Creating a new database connection for every request is expensive. Connection pools (e.g., HikariCP, Apache DBCP) manage a pool of reusable connections, reducing overhead and improving throughput.
  - Configure pool size based on your workload and database limits.

**2. Batch Inserts and Updates:**
  - Instead of executing single insert/update statements in a loop, use JDBC batch operations (`addBatch()` and `executeBatch()`).
  - This reduces network round-trips and improves performance, especially for large data loads.

**3. Proper Indexing:**
  - Ensure that frequently queried columns are indexed. Indexes speed up SELECT queries but can slow down INSERT/UPDATE, so use them judiciously.
  - Regularly analyze and optimize indexes as data and query patterns evolve.

**4. Prepared Statements:**
  - Use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection and benefit from statement caching at the database level.

**5. Minimize Result Set Size:**
  - Only select the columns you need. Avoid `SELECT *`.
  - Use pagination for large result sets.

## File and NIO (Non-blocking I/O)

**1. Use `java.nio` for Non-blocking I/O:**
  - The `java.nio` package provides channels and buffers for scalable, non-blocking I/O operations, suitable for high-performance applications.
  - Use selectors to handle multiple channels with a single thread.

**2. Buffered I/O Streams:**
  - Always wrap file streams with buffered streams (e.g., `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`) to reduce the number of physical I/O operations.

**3. Asynchronous File I/O:**
  - Use `AsynchronousFileChannel` for truly asynchronous file operations, which can improve throughput in I/O-bound applications.

**4. Resource Management:**
  - Always close streams and connections in a `finally` block or use try-with-resources to prevent resource leaks.
