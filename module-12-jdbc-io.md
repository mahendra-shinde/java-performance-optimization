# Module 12: JDBC and I/O Performance Optimization

## JDBC Tuning

**1. Use Connection Pooling:**
  - Creating a new database connection for every request is expensive. Connection pools (e.g., HikariCP, Apache DBCP) manage a pool of reusable connections, reducing overhead and improving throughput.
  - Configure pool size based on your workload and database limits.

**2. Batch Inserts and Updates:**
  - Instead of executing single insert/update statements in a loop, use JDBC batch operations (`addBatch()` and `executeBatch()`).
  - This reduces network round-trips and improves performance, especially for large data loads.

**3. Proper Indexing:**
  - Ensure that frequently queried columns are indexed. Indexes speed up SELECT queries but can slow down INSERT/UPDATE, so use them judiciously.
  - Regularly analyze and optimize indexes as data and query patterns evolve.

**4. Prepared Statements:**
  - Use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection and benefit from statement caching at the database level.

**5. Minimize Result Set Size:**
