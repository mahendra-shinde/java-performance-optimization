# Concurrency & Multithreading in Java (with Explanations)

Concurrency and multithreading are essential for building high-performance, scalable Java applications. Proper synchronization and thread management can maximize CPU utilization and prevent common pitfalls like deadlocks and race conditions.

## Synchronization Techniques

- **`synchronized` blocks**: Ensure that only one thread can execute a block of code at a time. Use for simple mutual exclusion but beware of performance bottlenecks if overused.
- **`ReentrantReadWriteLock`**: Allows multiple readers or one writer at a time. Improves performance for read-heavy workloads compared to `synchronized`.
- **`java.util.concurrent` package**: Provides advanced concurrency utilities like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, and thread pools. These classes are highly optimized and thread-safe.
- **Avoid contention and deadlocks**: Minimize the scope of locks, avoid nested locking, and use timeouts or try-locks to prevent deadlocks.

## Best Practices
- Prefer higher-level concurrency utilities over low-level synchronization.
- Use thread pools (`ExecutorService`) to manage threads efficiently.
- Monitor thread states and contention using tools like VisualVM and JConsole.
- Design for immutability where possible to reduce synchronization needs.

> **Tip:** Always test concurrent code under real-world load to uncover hidden issues.
