# Module 07: Essential Tools for Java Performance Tuning

Java performance optimization relies on a variety of tools to identify, analyze, and resolve bottlenecks. Each tool serves a specific purpose, from profiling CPU and memory usage to simulating load and analyzing garbage collection behavior. Below is a detailed overview of the most widely used tools, their features, and best practices for effective usage.

| Tool          | Purpose & Key Features                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JProfiler** | Comprehensive CPU/memory/thread profiling, heap dump analysis, allocation hotspots,   |
|               | method call tracing, and real-time monitoring. Integrates with IDEs and CI pipelines. |
| **GCViewer**  | Visualizes and analyzes JVM garbage collection logs. Helps tune GC parameters,        |
|               | identify pause times, and understand memory allocation patterns.                      |
| **VisualVM**  | Free, all-in-one JVM monitoring tool. Offers CPU/memory profiling, heap dump         |
|               | analysis, thread inspection, and JMX monitoring. Supports remote profiling.           |
| **JConsole**  | Lightweight JMX-based monitoring tool bundled with the JDK. Monitors memory, threads, |
|               | CPU, and MBeans. Useful for quick diagnostics.                                        |
| **JMeter**    | Open-source load testing tool. Simulates concurrent users, measures throughput,       |
|               | latency, and response times. Supports HTTP, JDBC, JMS, and more.                     |

## How to Use These Tools Effectively

- **Start with VisualVM or JConsole** for live monitoring and basic profiling.
